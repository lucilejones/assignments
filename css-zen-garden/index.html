            <p class="libre">Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,
                incompatible
                DOMs, broken
                CSS support, and abandoned browsers.</p>

            <p class="libre">We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the
                tireless efforts
                of folk like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators.</p>

            <p class="libre">The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the
                masters. Begin to
                see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become
                one
                with the web.</p>
            <span class="julius3">So What Is This About?</span>
            <p class="libre">There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite,
                inspire, and
                encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any
                one
                will load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has
                changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.</p>
            <p class="libre">CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only
                way
                this can be
                illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the
                reins
                are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike
                have
                contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="main2">
            <span class="julius3">Participation</span>
            <p class="libre">Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong
                CSS
                skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even CSS novices can
                use
                them as starting points. Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on
                working
                with CSS.</p>
            <p class="libre">You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem
                daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more,
                and
                use the sample files as a guide.</p>
            <p class="libre">Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed
                your
                masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server under
                your control. Send us a link to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose
                to
                use it we will download it and place it on our server.</p>
            <span class="julius3">Benefits</span>
            <p class="libre">Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to
                showing
                people how amazing CSS really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working
                on
                the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can
                all
                look forward to.</p>

        <div id="main3">
            <span class="julius3">Requirements</span>
            <p class="libre">Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be
                limited to
                widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about
                functional, practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing
                public.
                The
                only real requirement we have is that your CSS validates.</p>
            <p class="libre">Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by
                now.
                When
                sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due
                to
                the
                sheer number of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in mobile —
                pixel-perfect
                layouts may not be possible across every platform. That's okay, but do test in as many as you can.
                Your
                design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by
                over
                90% of the population).</p>
            <p class="libre">We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep
                objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to
                your
                work. We're well past the point of needing another garden-related design.
                This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics
                (with
                limited exceptions, see submission guidelines), but we ask you release your CSS under a Creative
                Commons
                license identical to the one on this site so that others may learn from your work.</p>
